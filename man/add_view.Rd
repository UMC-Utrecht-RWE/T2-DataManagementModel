\title{Add a transformation step to a DuckDB view pipeline}
\usage{
add_view(con, pipeline, transform_sql, base_table = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{DuckDB connection object.}

\item{pipeline}{Name of the pipeline (e.g., "persons").}

\item{transform_sql}{SQL transformation query as a string. Use `%s` as a
placeholder for the current view name.}

\item{base_table}{Optional. Name of the base table to initialize the pipeline
if it does not exist yet. Required if the pipeline is being created for the
first time.}
}
\description{
This function adds a new transformation step to a versioned view pipeline
stored entirely within DuckDB. Each step creates a new view based on the
previous step, and a final alias view (e.g., `persons_view`) always points
to the latest version of the pipeline.
}
\details{
If the pipeline does not exist yet, the function will automatically
initialize it from a specified base table and create the first version.
