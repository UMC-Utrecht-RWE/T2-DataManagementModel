\arguments{
\item{con}{Connection object.
A DuckDB connection object.}

\item{data_model}{Character.
The data model to use (e.g., `"conception"`).}

\item{excel_path_to_cdm_schema}{Character.
Path to the Excel file containing the CDM schema.}

\item{format_source_files}{Character.
Format of the source files, either `"csv"` or `"parquet"`.}

\item{folder_path_to_source_files}{Character.
Path to the folder containing source files.
Ensure the path ends with a `'/'`.}

\item{through_parquet}{Character.
Whether to process through Parquet files (`"yes"` or `"no"`).}

\item{create_db_as}{Character.
Specify whether to create the database as `"views"` or `"tables"`.}

\item{tables_in_cdm}{Character vector.
A character vector of table names that are expected in the CDM.}
}
\value{
None.
The function performs operations to load data into a DuckDB database.
}
\description{
This function orchestrates the full pipeline for loading source data into a
 Common Data Model (CDM) structure using DuckDB. It validates inputs, sets up
 schemas, reads source files, creates empty CDM tables, populates them, and
 optionally combines intermediate Parquet views.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Validates input parameters.
  \item In the DuckDB connection, creates necessary schemas.
  \item Reads source files and creates SQL views.
  \item Creates empty CDM tables based on the schema definition.
  \item Populates CDM tables from source views.
  \item Optionally combines intermediate Parquet views into final views.
  \item Closes the database connection and performs cleanup.
