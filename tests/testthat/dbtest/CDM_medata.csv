Birth with type of birth not known should be transmitted to EUROCAT, but will be excluded from routine EUROCAT analysis.
EUROCAT includes all livebirths, fetal deaths with gestational age (GA) ≥20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy (at any gestational age) after prenatal diagnosis of malformation.  Fetal deaths with GA < 20 weeks (code =
3) may be reported to EUROCAT but will not be included in prevalence data.
The distinction between stillbirth and spontaneous abortion should follow the definitions in use in your country (to be specified in your Registry Description).  There is usually a lower gestational age limit or birthweight limit for stillbirths.  This varies from country to country.  Below this limit fetal deaths are called spontaneous abortions.
Terminations of pregnancy refer to cases where prenatal diagnosis was made of malformation in a live fetus and the pregnancy was then terminated.  If the fetus died spontaneously in utero either before or after prenatal diagnosis of malformation then it should be coded as spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, not as termination of pregnancy.  If a termination was performed for other reasons than malformation, the case should not be transmitted to Central Registry.  This means that early terminations where there was no suspicion of malformation before termination should be excluded from the case files.
Stillbirths or perinatal deaths resulting from termination of pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis must be coded as terminations (value = 4), irrespective of civil registration status.

When each anomaly was first diagnosed.
The basis for this variable is to record whether the prenatal findings strongly suggest the postnatal diagnosis. This variable is not designed for fetal medicine specialists to assess the accuracy of their prenatal diagnosis. Thus the finding of a significant heart anomaly prenatally is considered to be prenatally detected, even if the exact anomaly was not correctly diagnosed. ‘Yes, prenatally diagnosed’, should be used when the prenatal finding is nearly 100% predictive of the congenital anomaly. ‘Partially’ means that the prenatal finding is consistent with the postnatal anomaly but has a lesser predictive value, being suggestive of more than one type of anomaly, an example here would be increased nuchal translucency. The examples below are to illustrate this principle and ensure consistency of coding. Queries about individual cases can be send to Central registry";NA;"EUROCAT";NA;"presyn"

An HbA1c of 48mmol/mol is recommended as the cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes.

 Type of medication is unknown.
“Medication taken but timing unknown” means that the usual data sources stated that medication was taken but the timing of use was not stated for some or all of the medications.
Use this option also for cases in which the data sources clearly state that certain medication was taken in the first trimester, but for other medication the timing was unknown.

“Not Known” means that the usual data sources were not found.

 Use of folic acid (either as folic acid only tablets or a multivitamin preparation which contains folic acid) should be registered in the folic acid variable
 Do not include usual vitamins and mineral supplementation, but include unusual intakes of vitamins or minerals (eg. Vitamin A mega doses).
